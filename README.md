# COTW trophy viewer

Wanted to be able to search/sort what I do/don't have in my trophy lodge, seems to work, YMMV!

## Installation 

Download binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/tom-power/cotw-trophy-viewer/releases/latest) and run locally.

## Run/build

```
git clone https://github.com/tom-power/cotw-trophy-viewer.git &&
cd cotw-trophy-viewer
```

then

- windows `sh\setup.bat && sh\build.bat`
- unix `sh/setup.sh && sh/build.sh`

check `sh` for other scripts to run locally etc

## Notes/todo/help

- `fur type` don't know how to get names, including ids in the grid for now as a reminder
- `animal type` these are mapped, if you have an animal in your lodge without a name please shout
- `medals` these are mapped, if you see some inaccuracy please shout 
- [Parque Fernando lodge](https://thehuntercotw.fandom.com/wiki/Missions/Parque_Fernando_Missions#Main_Missions) don't know if this shows up or not as haven't got to it in the game

## Questions

- `include all animals` in filter, idea is to include unmounted animals so you know what's left, is this intuitive? 
- `and or` in the filter, will anyone ever use `or`?

## Thanks

Lots copied from these, thanks!
