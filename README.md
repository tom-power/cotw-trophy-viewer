# COTW trophy viewer

Wanted to be able to search/sort what I do/don't have in my trophy lodge, seems to work, YMMV!

## Installation 

Download binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/tom-power/cotw-trophy-viewer/releases/latest) and run locally.

## Run/build

```

then

- windows `sh\setup.bat && sh\build.bat`
- unix `sh/setup.sh && sh/build.sh`

check `sh` for other scripts to run locally etc

## TODO/help

Any help with the below is welcome through issues etc

### Names

- don't know how to get names for `fur type` currently so haven't included, this would be good though
- likely missing some animal names, when you have an animal in your lodge and this is the case, their name won't appear in the `Animal` column

> **_NOTE:_**  Have been guessing animal names and checking in `test_hash.py`, probably easier not to hash in the first place, but I haven't explored.

### Medals

These are mapped from difficulty and may be wrong
