## Help

Don't know how to get these names currently, any help welcome!

- ~~lodges~~
- fur types <- this would be great
- very likely some animals, their name won't appear in the `Animal` column, then been guessing names and checking in `test_hash.py`

Any help with theming/making it look more hunty also welcome :)
